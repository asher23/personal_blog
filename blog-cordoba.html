         Return of the Moors: Cordoba
        </h3>
        Bismillah.<br>Cordoba gave me something I didn't know I needed. Let's rewind a bit. Cordoba is our first real destination. Casablanca and Madrid were both waypoints. By that I mean the trip really began for me in a new way upon arriving here in Cordoba. So we land on the train platform at 10:22pm, quickly connect with the Airbnb host on check-in details, hail a taxi, get the apartment keys from a lockbox somewhere in town, continue to the apartment, make our way inside, and I sigh with relief(I must have though I'm really not sure). Our apartment is across street from the Mezquita Catedral--set in a the heart of a quaint town that calls back to a time where streets were built for walking and homes where situated as close as possible to centers of worship. The climate is not very spiritual here, but it is clear that this place was built by centuries of people who knew the importance of God.<br><br>I mention beginnings because in a few ways, I've yet to experience the stark emotional shift to announce the clear beginning of this trip. There was the moment I began packing. There was the moment I dapped my brother up at the airport. There was the moment Taj, Akrem, I met in the terminal. There was the moment I faced a swarm of headscarves boarding the plane bound for Casablanca. There was the moment I stood on the balcony of our apartment taking in the view of the Mezquita Catedral and cobblestone streets of Cordoba. Each of these moments holds their own sense of incipience--some more than others--but so having so many moments underscores truth that there has been no single moment of outset. All at once I feel as I would still being Brooklyn, boarding an international flight, preoccupied to with prior commitments, and traveling the world with friends. How can that allow for a sense of presence.<br><br>Walking into the Mezquita Catedral I was at a loss for words. The awe of beholding millennium-old Moorish archways(made real from the pages of a text) held the raucous of tourist whispers and the disquiet of an elusive sense of presence at bay long enough for me to feel. Only that. Standing at the entrance to the once-prayerroom of the Mezquita, I had not words for what I felt and no pressing need to define the nothingness. For the next 3 hours, we wandered the inner sanctum of this place. We learned history of Cordoba's conquerors: Romans, Visigoths, Moors in 700s CE, and Spanish in 1200s. We learned how the Mosque itself was commissioned by an exiled Prince Abdurrahman I in 786CE and renovated several times over for the next 200 years. We laughed at the consistency of human nature, the way a Jumu'ah parking lot in the 800s functions much the same way it does today: "Brother there a horse and cart that's blocking the rest of the brothers, please finish your sunnahs and move it." We took a bunch of pictures. We found bites around town. We spoke to strangers.<br><br>We are in the midst of our adventures, and all the while I am holding this sense of confusion. "where is this sense of beginning that I'm looking for? What is my dynamic in travel group? What am I hoping to get from this trip, really? Why am I here? Where am I?"<br><br>As we leave Cordoba, I still hold some of these questions; I am not sure what is different, but somehow these questions are no longer a burden. They are here. And so am I. Wherever here is. Wherever here will take us. I'm content to have arrived and I excited for what comes next.<br><br>Next stop: Granada<br>
