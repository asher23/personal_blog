Walking through the streets of Madrid, lugging a cumbersome suitcase through roads plastered with soggy dirt and cobblestones whilst braving intermittent sun showers, I realized seeing Madrid the second time through is a huge comfort. The circumstances at face value are uncomfortable. Upon closer inspection, they're still uncomfortable, but I'm with friends and good company has a light of its own. Akrem and Taj bring a light that I'm looking forward to uncovering in the next weeks we'll spend traveling together. That said, the comfort of Madrid the second time for me is in all that which I do not see.
The three of us weave through foot traffic of afternoon Madrid. McDonalds. Narrow street. Plaza Del Sol. Twisty streets. Quick drizzle. Plaza Mayor. Each new sight as we walk along these streets is hardly a new sight. Even so, I'm doing alright…and there's three small comforts in that simple fact:
1) The world is full of exciting things and new sites. These adventures can be tamed.
2) The same adventure in different company is a different adventure. Company is important
3) Uplifting community is rare. It is something worth insistence and sacrifice. Stay the course.
 
The world is full of exciting things and new sites. These adventures can be tamed.
The sheer quantity of cities and countrysides scattered throughout the world coupled with the variety of adventure available in a given city make adventure itself seem daunting. True, we do not adventure for the sake of conquering all adventure but still there is something to be said about feeling as though no amount of traveling can bring you closer to point of having seen enough. My first trip to Madrid lasted 3 days, and yet the second time around I found myself recollecting odd street alleyways, recommending bakeries, and nodding at all the tourist sights with patient familiarity. I have seen enough of Madrid for myself. The adventures of the world are waiting to be tamed…perhaps so that we can seek deeper sweetnesses.
 
The same adventure in different company is a different adventure. Company is important
Deeper sweetness. I'm not sure what that is but I have a clue that part of it lies in the people who accompany you on your adventures. We walked through Parque del Retiro. The trees were beautiful, with the inexhaustible beauty that is characteristic of nature, however, that novelty of the experience this time around came in observing and listening to Taj and Akrem as we all experienced the park together. We looked on at the same set of people and color-changing foliage, yet somehow, this brought us to conversation of National Healthcare, Spanish geopolitics, and more. In the midst of exploring we set our plans to weave through the essentials: food, prayer, exciting views. The point is, when you're in the company of those whose actions affirm your values and whose conversation expands your mind, no matter the destination it'll be time well spent.
 
Uplifting community is rare. It is something worth insistence and sacrifice. Stay the course.
I'll be honest, deriving this realization was a bit of a stretch. Still the truth of it is intact, I believe. When we stopped at a local mosque to pray, I was grateful for space to worship and relax. Increasingly secular times remind me not to take such a thing for granted. Sitting in my gratitude, though, I could not help but feel a sense of yearning for more. Coming upon mosques that hold the daily prayers and that have an attendance in the middle of a secular cosmopolis is huge, but it feels like surviving. I've been blessed to taste community that uplifts--where people remind you to pray AND urge you to consider the deeper meaning of your prayer, where greetings are full of pleasantries AND there is sincere follow-up about your personal day-to-day, and where thriving upon principles seems like a common aspiration. I've tasted it, which means it must exist. It doesn't exist everywhere. Wherever we find ourselves survival is the first order of business, however, I've been looking for spaces and places where excellence in character is something on the collective conscience. In such a space, I'm sure, there is a safety that is special--a safety worth insisting on and sacrificing for. I've been dissuaded  from that insistence in recent moments, but observing survival once more is a reminder of the beauty of simply being alive and it is a reminder that insistence has a place.
