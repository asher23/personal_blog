To enter into a new world is to let go of the strings that tie you to your present world. Traveling at once was just that. We leave our homes, our valuables, and our networks to journey into the unfamiliar, with only ourselves and what resources we can carry. Internet has relaxed the extent of necessary disconnection. Besides, it is not as though the attachments we relinquish are lost; they often remain until we return. I realize now that this has always been part my motivation for traveling. 

The Manhattan-like avenues of Santiago. The northeast coast of Brazil. The second row of the Hagiya Sofia. I've been blessed to travel many places. Each destination offers its own views, new people, different cuisines, and more; and I never know what I experiences will greet me in my travels.  What I am certain to find every time, should I return, is validation. Sometimes I meet life long friends on my travels, some times I discover foods that will forever be a adjective in my description of my favorite flavors, and some times I return disappointed. If I come back, though, my trip is unequivocal proof that I my value is inherent to who I am--untethered from the things I own and the people I know. My faith tells me this much: that people are valuable simply for their being a creation of The Most High. Nevertheless it helps to be reassured with the knowledge that I have all I need to survive.

Traveling has so much to offer. It is an incredible privilege that we are not all afforded--one that we are no lesser for should we never taste it. Validation is one gift traveling has given me. In time, God-willing, I will unpack more gifts of traveling, and discover blessings Ive already picked up along the way.
