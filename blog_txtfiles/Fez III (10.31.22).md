blog_content : 
Time is viscous
Woodcarved ceilings
Stonework walls
Mosaic floors
Woodcarved doors
Stonework ceilings 
Mosaic walls
Are rough with ancient influence
The flow of centuries at a standstill at the reaches of every room
In each castle
In these medinas
We stare across the boundary layers and peel back dynasties
The swell of history in these spaces remind me that there are monarchs long gone who bowed to the same God I do. We are brothers. 
Reminds me that I come from kings
who bowed to the same God I do.
